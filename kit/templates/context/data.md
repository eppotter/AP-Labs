# Data canon

Written by the Onboarder for SQLsmith. Everything here was said by the client's people, proved by
a check, and signed by the owner above. Anything not yet checked or signed is marked
`unverified` with the gap stated.

## Data model

<!-- The systems that hold data, and how the main entities relate. -->

## Approved sources

<!-- One entry per table or view a build may use: name, what it holds, its owner. -->

## Grain notes

<!-- For each approved source: one row per what? Note any duplicates, soft deletes or late-arriving rows. -->

## Join patterns

<!-- The approved join between each pair of sources: keys, whether the key is unique on each side, and fan-out risks. -->

## Terminology

<!-- Each business term mapped to its columns and filters, and what it explicitly excludes. -->

## Metric definitions

<!--
One rule card per metric (docs/reference/05-discovery-process.md §3), types metric_definition or derived_metric:

### RULE-ID: name
- rule: plain-language definition a non-technical person agrees with; the formula below it
- owner: client person who confirms it
- evidence: the source, session or document it came from, and its tests (min 2 worked examples)
- status: draft | challenged | approved | retired (approved only with the owner's sign-off and date)
-->

## Deprecated sources

<!-- Each source a build must not use, why, and what replaces it. -->

## Known truths

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Story 4.2 defines the entry format (each known truth carries a check, expected value, tolerance, owner and sign-off). Do not add entries until that format lands. -->
